<p>I’m a convex combination of an economist and data scientist.</p>

<p>My research focuses on developing data products to optimize marketing decisions such as advertising, targeting, and pricing. The algorithmic solutions we propose are typically motivated by some basic microeconomic or behavioral principles and implemented with the state-of-the-art techniques in causal inference (both experimental and observational) and machine learning (e.g., computer vision, reinforcement learning). I’m also broadly interested in the nascent creator economy.</p>

<p>Before joining Harvard Business School, I received my PhD in management from the <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

My current research combines tools in econometrics, machine learning and leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) to optimize marketing decisions and answer questions of general interest in social sciences. I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic psychological and neurological principles.
I have two lines of research on learning to design and deliver interventions. On the design side, I work on content strategy in creator economy. On the delivery side, I work on targeting policies. 
One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles. 
(e.g., video, text, map and network)
understanding consumer behaviors more broadly and how they interact with these algorithmic products. My recent work studies topics in 
My current research focuses on optimizing managerial decisions such as advertising, pricing and targeting by developing algorithmic products that turn big unstructured data into actionable insights.
