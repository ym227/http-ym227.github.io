<p>I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in operations management at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington.</p>

<p>My board research interests lie in data-driven service operations and behavioral operations management. I am particularly interested in exploring how fundamental operational drivers impact consumer behavior in service systems, and how firms use such behavioral insights to improve consumer experience and system performance. In collaboration with a major ride-sharing platform, I have pursued these research questions by designing complex field experiments and analyzing large and highly granular data sets. <\p>

<p>Prior to UW, I received my BS in Statistics from the <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)</a>.</p>
